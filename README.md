# Print Friendly Coding Exercise

This exercise is designed to assess your technical abilities, and to give you an opportunity to demonstrate your skills. It is not a test, and there are no
right or wrong answers. We are interested in seeing how you approach the problem, and how you solve it. This can give both of us an opportunity understand what
it would be like working together.

The requirements are simple, but once you have completed them, we will go through the explorations to iterate on your solution together.

You will be using your personal computer and your development environment of choice. You will be using Next.js and Puppeteer to complete this exercise. And you
will need Node.js 19.6.0 or higher installed on your machine.
